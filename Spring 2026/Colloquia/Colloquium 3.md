I had seen the usage of Raman Spectroscopy in Quantum Materials, but I don't fully understand it. She mentioned another mechanism that had that one distribution that shows up in optics a lot, and in the coefficient being near +/- 1 it had resonance and antiresonance.

I don't know. I don't really know much about her topic in general. Presentation was decent, seems like she has done presentations before.

I'm sorry that I'm a little out of it, I did pay attention and take some notes, but it didn't feel like much stuck in terms of what was particular exciting in the presentation.

I had been late because I was talking to a friend about getting help with advocacy in Ph.D.

I liked his description of optical tools/mechanics, and the different technologies for the generation of entangled photon pairs and their efficacies.

I wasn't as understanding about what exactly was the demonstrated new technology, but that could be because I paid less attention as the talk went on longer.

I found his original explanation of quantum computing a bit underwhelming for a general audience. I also noticed that his pacing was projected to exceed the time allotted.

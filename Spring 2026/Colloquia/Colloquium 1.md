The whole concept of quantum repeaters is very interesting. I was thinking about I would implement my own mechanisms for quantum state information transfer based off of what she had talked about.

What I do wonder, however, is the interaction of optical cables with photons carrying information, since I was under the impression that there would be some level of decoherence.

I didn't understand as much about the whole process of using NV-centers in diamonds for detection, but I understand the general principle of SSNMR. I think elaborating a bit more on how mechanistically we do measurement and processing from the NVs would have been interesting.

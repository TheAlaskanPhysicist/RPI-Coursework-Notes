2nd "Renie?" Entropy

Investigate correlators

Entropy vs. Partition Size
 - Bipartition entanglement between "system" and "environment"

Interdependency nearest neighbor does not show behavior
All-to-All does
Where does that transition occur?

Reimplement initial-state vector problem (for kinds of initial configuration)

Simulation on quantum hardware?

Develop list of quantum phase transition characteristics.

## Coulomb's Law
A typical course of Electrostatics starts from the quantitative statement of Coulomb's law.
Experimentally observed by Coulomb, it was shown that:
1. $\vec{F}$ is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charges
2. $\vec{F}$ is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
3. $\vec{F}$ is directed in a line spanned by the two position vectors
4. $\vec{F}$ is attractive when opposite charges, and repulsive with like charges.
Thus, for non-moving charges, we can write:
$$\begin{align}
\vec F&\propto\dfrac{q_1q_2}{|\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2|^2}\cdot\dfrac{\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2}{|\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2|}
\end{align}$$
Where $q_1,q_2$ are the charges of the interaction. This proportionality factor can also be introduced to make this force into a strict equality, and is defined to be:
$$\begin{align}
\vec F&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{q_1q_2}{|\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2|^2}\cdot\dfrac{\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2}{|\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2|}
\end{align}$$
If we let $\vec{r}=\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2$ to be the displacement vector, with magnitude $r=|\vec{r}|$, it can be simplified to:
$$\begin{align}
\vec F&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}
\end{align}$$
### Electric Field
Suppose we wanted represent this force field as to be agnostic to a test charge. If we can separate the force equation into some function of force and test charge to one side, the other side would be entirely dependent on the source charge and the displacement from it thereof.

Define $q_1=Q$ to be the source of electric field. Since we can choose our point of origin, let $\vec{r}_1=\vec{0}$.
Define $q_2=q$ to be the test charge. Its displacement from the source charge is then $\vec{r}_2=\vec{r}$.

Substituting into the Coulomb force, we see that:
$$\begin{align}
\vec F&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{q_1q_2}{|\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2|^2}\cdot\dfrac{\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2}{|\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2|} & \implies && \Aboxed{\vec F(\vec{r})&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{Qq}{r^2}\hat{r}}
\end{align}$$
Notice, however, that this is neatly separatable to have a new quantity that is independent of the test charge, and thus is only dependent on the source charge:
$$\begin{align}
\dfrac{\vec F(\vec{r})}{q}&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{Q}{r^2}\hat{r} & \implies && \Aboxed{\vec E(\vec{r})&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{Q}{r^2}\hat{r}}
\end{align}$$
This "force per unit charge" is what we define as the *electric field*. Therefore, this is the electric field generated by a point charge of $Q$ at a displacement $\vec{r}$ away.


### Distribution of Charges
Suppose we wanted to determine the electric field of a large number of point charges, packed densely enough to be written as a continuous charge field. If we implicitly differentiate the electric field equation from earlier, we get:
$$\begin{align}
d\vec E(\vec{r})&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{dQ}{r^2}\hat{r}
\end{align}$$
Effectively, we can break up the sum of charges and add their contribution to electric field. For the instance of a 3D volume such as our universe, we can write $dQ$ as the following:
$$\begin{align}
dQ&=\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial V}dV=\rho(\vec{r})dV
\end{align}$$
We can reintegrate the equation from above with this new substitution to find:
$$\begin{align}
\vec E(\vec{r})&=\int\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{dQ}{r^2}\hat{r}\\
&=\int_V\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{\rho(\vec{r})}{r^2}\hat{r}\ dV\\
\Aboxed{\vec E(\vec{r})&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_V\dfrac{\rho(\vec{r})}{r^2}\hat{r}\ dV}
\end{align}$$
To achieve back the result of point charges, we can use the Dirac delta function, where if we want a point charge of $q$ at $\vec{a}$, we can write the density as $\rho(\vec{r})=q\cdot\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{a})$.


## Gauss's Law
Direct integration of a distribution of charges isn't always practical. 
Another result is called Gauss's law which becomes more useful as it leads to a differential equation for $\vec{E}(\vec{r})$ instead of an integral expression:
$$\begin{align}
\oint_{\partial V}\vec{E}\cdot\hat{n}\ da&=\dfrac{1}{\epsilon_0}\int_V\rho(\vec{r})\ dV
\end{align}$$
Effectively, the integral of the electric field perpendicular to the surface, over it's whole bounded surface, is proportional to the charge enclosed by that surface.

We can actually use Stokes' Theorem in order to simplify this expression. Recall:
$$\begin{align}
\oint_{\partial V}\vec{F}\cdot\hat{n}\ da&=\int_{V}\left(\vec\nabla\cdot\vec{F}\right)\cdot dV
\end{align}$$
Substituting back, we can see:
$$\begin{align}
\int_{V}\left(\vec\nabla\cdot\vec{E}\right)\cdot dV&=\dfrac{1}{\epsilon_0}\int_V\rho(\vec{r})\ dV
\end{align}$$
We can rearrange this to find that:
$$\begin{align}
\int_{V}\left(\vec\nabla\cdot\vec{E}-\dfrac{\rho(\vec{r})}{\epsilon_0}\right)\cdot dV&=0
\end{align}$$
In order for this integral expression to be zero, the internal terms must be as well. Therefore:
$$\begin{align}
\Aboxed{\vec\nabla\cdot\vec{E}&=\dfrac{\rho(\vec{r})}{\epsilon_0}}
\end{align}$$
## Electric Field as a Potential
Another simplification we can make is if we impose that $\vec\nabla\times\vec{E}=0$. 
Define a new scalar field $\phi$ such that $\vec{E}(\vec{r})=-\vec\nabla\phi(\vec{r})$. We can also take our current integral expression and extract a gradient so that:
$$\begin{align}
\vec E(\vec{r})&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_V\rho(\vec{r})\dfrac{1}{r^2}\hat{r}\ dV\\
-\vec\nabla\phi(\vec{r})&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_V\rho(\vec{r})\vec\nabla\left(-\dfrac{1}{r}\right)\ dV\\
\vec\nabla\phi(\vec{r})&=\vec\nabla\left(\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_V\dfrac{\rho(\vec{r})}{r}\ dV\right)\\
\Aboxed{\phi(\vec{r})&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_V\dfrac{\rho(\vec{r})}{r}\ dV}
\end{align}$$
### Extensions to the Potential
Our choice of differentials on which to take on the charge distribution can be somewhat removed as to be in terms of $dQ$ similar to the previous derivations:
$$\begin{align}
\Aboxed{\phi(\vec{r})&=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\dfrac{dQ(\vec{r})}{r}}
\end{align}$$
Through the total differential, we can write this however we feel, such as:
$$\begin{align}
dQ_\text{1D}&=\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial s}ds=\lambda(\vec{r})\ ds\\
dQ_\text{2D}&=\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial a}da=\sigma(\vec{r})\ da\\
dQ_\text{3D}&=\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial v}dv=\rho(\vec{r})\ dv\\
\end{align}$$
The most general form really just is some differential charge element, and so is recommended to keep it in this form, since the specific differential basis is chosen as needed.

Using our definition of the potential in terms of electric field, we can find that:
$$\begin{align}
\Aboxed{\vec\nabla^2\phi(\vec{r})&=-\dfrac{\rho(\vec{r})}{\epsilon_0}}
\end{align}$$

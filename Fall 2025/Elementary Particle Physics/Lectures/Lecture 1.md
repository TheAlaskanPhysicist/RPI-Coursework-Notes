#### Lepton Number
Conservation of lepton number (1962):
$$\begin{align}
\pi^-&\rightarrow\mu^-+\bar\nu_\mu\\
\mu^-&\rightarrow e^-+\nu_\mu+\bar\nu_e
\end{align}$$
If neutrinos are their own antiparticles, then Lepton Number would be violated.
Neutrino oscillation already violates this principle.

#### Strangeness
Quantum number $S$ is conserved by strong interactions.
 - It is violated by weak interactions.
Hyperons have $S=-1$, Kaons have $S=1$.

The 8-fold way is organizing mesons into $\text{SU}(3)$ weight diagrams.

#### Tensor Products (with the 8-fold way)
Some examples are:
$$\begin{align}
3\otimes3&=3\oplus6\\
3\otimes\bar3&=1\oplus8\\
3\otimes3\otimes3&=1\oplus8\oplus8\oplus10\\
\end{align}$$
Only the right side of equation 2 and 3 were observed, but 1 was not.
This suggested that baryons and mesons were composite of triplets and antitriplets.


#### The Quark Model
The building blocks of hadrons are triplets and antitriplets of $\text{SU}(3)$.
Thus quarks came in 3 flavors ($u,d,s$) in addition to antiquarks.
 - Mesons: $q\bar q'\sim 3\otimes\bar3$
 - Baryons: $qq'q''\sim 3\otimes3\otimes3$
But why no diquarks? What's binding them anyways?

#### Color as an $\text{SU}(3)$ symmetry
All natural particles are color singlets.
 - Combinations of colorless states invariant under $\text{SU(3)}$.
 - We label these as Red, Green, and Blue (as well as their anti-colors)
QCD formalized the prior questions above.

#### The Weak Particles
We expected intermediary particles for the weak force, but discovered that they have mass.
Under a theory of a field of $\text{SU}(2)$ invariance, this violated the idea of massive particles.

Only under the Higgs mechanism was the spontaneous mass generation (as well as the electroweak symmetry) broken in order to achieve our universe's physics.

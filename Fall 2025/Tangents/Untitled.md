If $X^\mu$ and $P_\mu$ are correlated, rather than independent, then the state of a system is on a constrained manifold of the system embedded in $8$-D parameter space.

Information Deficit:
$$\begin{align}
S&=-k\int f(X,P)\ln f(X,P) \ d^4 X\ d^4 P
\end{align}$$
With mutual information being:
$$\begin{align}
I(X;P)&=S_X+S_P-S_{XP} & I(P;X)&=S_X+S_P-S_{PX}
\end{align}$$
These should be equal to each other, since $S_{XP}=S_{PX}$ should be true.




## Entropy-Action Duality
Have a new parameter $\Sigma$ such that the following is analogous:
$$\begin{align}
e^{iS/\hbar}\rightarrow e^{\Sigma/k}
\end{align}$$
This encodes the idea that normally we can separate $S$ and $\Sigma$ as:
$$\begin{align}
S&\sim E t & S&\sim x p_x & S&\sim \vec{x}\cdot\vec{p}
\end{align}$$
But in the more general sense, since they can be any set of parameters like that:
$$\begin{align}
\Sigma&\sim TS & \Sigma&\sim kT\ln\Omega
\end{align}$$

In Ising Systems, there's an analogy between Temperature and Time.
There could be some other flow that encodes the spatial equiv of it, that has the same relations.
This is akin to energy and momentum being related by the metric tensor.

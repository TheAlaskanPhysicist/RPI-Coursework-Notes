We begin with the start of the Heisenberg Model with the constraints that the spins are being measured in the $z$-basis, and the magnetic field is transverse, and so $H=h\sigma^x$.
$$\begin{align}
H&=-J\sum_j\sigma^z_{j}\sigma^z_{j+1}-h\sum_j\sigma^x_{j}+\sum_{j,k}f_{\left|j-k\right|}\sigma^x_{j} \sigma^x_{k}
\end{align}$$
We add an additional

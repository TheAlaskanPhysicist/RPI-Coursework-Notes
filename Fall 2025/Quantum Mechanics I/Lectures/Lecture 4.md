### Observables
Observations are compatible when $\left[A,B\right]=0$, and are representable by the same eigenbasis.

### Uncertainty
For some operator $A$, define the following:
$$\begin{align}
\Delta A&\equiv A-\braket{A} & \implies\\
(\Delta A)^2&=\braket{A^2}-\braket{A}^2
\end{align}$$
This is called the dispersion of $A$, and also the variance of $A$: $\sigma_A^2$.

The uncertainty relationship is then:
$$\begin{align}
\Aboxed{(\Delta A)^2(\Delta B)^2\ge\left|\dfrac{\braket{[A,B]}}{2i}\right|^2}
\end{align}$$

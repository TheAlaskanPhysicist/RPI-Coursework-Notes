This book aims to show the flaws in Classical Mechanics and then expand on how one could solve the issues that arise in order to achieve Quantum Mechanics.
## 1.1 The Stern-Gerlach Experiment
If classical mechanics predicted the results for the Stern-Gerlach experiment, then the beam should have a continuous distribution since the spin direction could continuously be rotated. 
However, the experiment showed that the beam is split into two distinct beams, as if there are only two directions that the spin could be measured.

The choice of measurement axis changes the result to be either parallel or anti-parallel.
It is not possible to measure more than 1 spin axes simultaneously.

This is similar to the polarization of light in electromagnetic wave theory.

## 1.2 Kets, Bras, and Operators
Ket space is a special vector space called a Hilbert Space.

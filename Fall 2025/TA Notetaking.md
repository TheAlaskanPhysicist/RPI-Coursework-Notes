## Classroom Management and Effective TA Strategies
List of all true statements:
 - Teaching is a job
 - Teaching can be extremely rewarding
 - Teaching can be very challenging
 - Teaching is teamwork

Support your team:
 - Be as accommodating as possible
 - Be available to swap office hours and assignments
 - Fill time questionnaires with all the times you could be available
 - Volunteer for requests made to the whole team

Support yourself:
- Watch your hours you spend on work (less than 20, not more than others)
- Put and enforce limits on TA work to make space for your own academic work
- Make time for yourself (free time to do things other than work)
- It's all about balance

Teaching is about values.

Set up ground rules, for students and yourself.
 - Decide on your core values ahead of time and try your best to stick to them.
	 - Respect for students
	 - Respect for your self and your health
	 - Fairness for all students
	 - Creating the best learning environment possible
	 - Equal access to course materials
 - Think about how you want to be treated.

Now experimenting with sticking to these ground rules.
 - The ground rules help you treat everyone consistently and explain your decisions
	 - Amount of time spent answering a single student's questions
	 - Queueing of requests
	 - Amount of feedback on assignments
	 - Correcting errors you may have made
	 - Granting of exceptions to students
 - Be they must be fair and equitable
 - Communicate the rules clearly by setting expectations early on
 - If there is a change, notify everyone clearly and why
 - You will be tested and it will be hard

Facilitating a good learning environment involves:
 - Couldn't write this fast enough.

You can help students achieve this by:
 - Trying you best to cultivate a growth mindset in students
 - Always make you answers.

Mindset impacts our learning.

Fixed mindset:
 - People believe their basic qualities, like intelligent or talent, are fixed traits.
 - Being constantly told you are good or bad at something can lead to this mindset and distress.

Growth mindset:
 - People believe that they can improve their abilities through dedication and hard work.
 - While upper limits still exist...

Try to learn something totally new, something that feels hard and very scary.

Facilitating a growth mindset:
 - Anyone who practices a material can do better in that material.
 - It may take some students more practice than the others to solve a problem.
	 - That's just life. We all have topics that comes easy or hard.
	 - Being challenged is good, means you are actually learning something new.
 - Solving a problem doesn't mean you actually learned the material or can solve a different one easily.
 - Asking yourself "do I understand why this is so..." i.e. metacognition is as important as doing exercises.

We can learn nearly as much from an experiment that does not work as one that does.
Failure is not something to be avoided but rather something to be cultivated.

Biases can undermine the learning environment
 - We all come from many different cultures.
 - Our environment and culture has many biases.
 - Sometimes we are aware of them, and often we are not.
 - These biases can have major impacts on our interactions and learning outcomes for students.

Biases are prejudices in favor of or against people who are like us.
Recognizing our own biases is already a big step.
 - Be aware of judgements you make and how those impact your interactions.
 - Who gets your time and who does not.
 - Do you challenge one individual and not another.
	 - Is there a valid reason? (understanding material)
	 - Or generalizing how well you think a specific group should know such material.

People are not statistics. Talk to them as students, not as a member of a group.

PAUSE to reflect on biases:
 - **P**ay attention to what's actually happening, what you are feeling, and how you are acting in a specific situation.
 - **A**cknowledge your own reactions, interpretations, and judgements.
 - **U**nderstand the other possible reactions, interpretations, and judgements that may be possible.
 - **S**earch for a more constructive, empowering, or productive way to deal with the situation.
 - **E**????? Engage?

I guess people need to be taught to think critically? This is why I have bias against neurotypicals...

Reduce bias in our interactions
 - Focus should be on providing the same treatment for all
 - ??? thanks presenter

Managing classroom disruptions
 - Acting out, tantrums.
 - Students feeling to uncomfortable to set through class.
 - Students with comments/behaviors that are not conducive to classroom learning.

Methods for successful intervention:
 - Confrontation (direct)
 - Shifting focus (distract)
 - Shifting responsibility (delegate)
Always inform the course instructor of disruptions and work on strategies together.

Practice stress reduction methods for yourself and your class
 - Learn methods to relax yourself and reflect them on students as appropriate.
 - Reduce methods that enforce perfectionism and unnecessary competition
 - Be flexible when you can
 - Patience patience

You are a student, a teacher, and a human being, all at once.
 - Keeping a balance is required when approaching teaching.

## Some presentation by a graduate student
Working with new students
 - Multimodal style
 - Observe and assess (ask good questions)
 - Adapt

Larger groups
 - Group-level assessment
 - Tailoring towards mixed-style audiences

## Challenges to Authority / Expertise
Sometime there are questions that you can't answer. That's fine.
Most students aren't out to get you, they're just curious.
We don't want to train students to "take someone's word for it."
We want them to question claims and assumptions. To think critically.

Authority does matter in laboratory environments.
Students need to listen to you and follow safety rules.
 - For the safety of the student and others.
In order to maintain safety, you must exercise authority.
 - Give warnings
 - Pause the whole lab section
 - Ask them to leave
 - Call public safety

---
## Feedback
Constructive, honest feedback that maintains motivation.
 - Be precise
 - Find the problem
 - Show examples
 - Acceptance
 - Be honest
 - How to get it right
With professors
 - Talk to the instructor
 - Provide update
 - Use the rubrics
 - Set the bar
 - Expectations
 - Ask for help

---
## Plagiarism
Why integrity matters?
 - Fairness (undermines and devalues honest students' works)
 - Reputation (can risk program and university accreditation)

Key resources:
 - Student Handbook
 - Course Syllabus

Examples of Academic Dishonesty (Student Handbook)
 - Plagiarism
 - Academic Fraud
 - Fabrication
 - Unauthorized Collaboration
 - Sabotage

Warning Signs of Academic Dishonesty
 - Sudden shifts in writing style, quality, or ability level
 - Work that doesn't align with class discussions or past performance
 - Identical or suspiciously similar submissions among students
 - Unusual patterns during exams (wandering eyes, hidden devices)
 - References to concepts not covered in class
 - Inconsistent formatting within a single document
Red flags are not evidence, but they can be used to make a case.

What TAs should do (end all, always talk to professor)
 - Document clearly
 - Stay professional, don't take it personally
 - Report properly
 - Follow policy
Report, not adjudicate. You provide evidence for the professor to judge.

What TAs should **not** do
 - Don't handle cases alone
 - Don't confront aggressively
 - Don't promise outcomes

When procedure is needed, reference the student handbook.
 - Let the instructor know as soon as possible.
 - Document your findings.
 - Let the instructor and admin do their thing. They'll reach out if needed.

Self-Protections for TAs
 - Keep all interactions professional and documented
 - Never make exceptions or deals outside official policy
 - Consult with the instructor if unsure.
 - ...

## TA work-life balance
The three pillars: Life, Research, Teaching Assistant. (4 if you included classes)

Strategy and Tools
 - Write down responsibilities
 - What do I need to do? Be realistic
 - When am I going to do it? Be specific

Give specific instructions about how you want things structured with students.
 - Enforcing things makes it much easier to grade.

Track your hours to make sure you're within reasonable time.
 - Inform your professor when it's not.

## Ideas to Include in Paper Writeup
The whole process of education, especially in secondary and post-secondary education, is a topic of many centuries of research, discussion, and developments; much of which is ongoing.

While I believe that students are somewhat responsible for prompting the teacher for help with questions, I know it can be a burden for those who are shy, or have a sense of being judged for asking questions. Teachers must be aware of students' struggles before they are. While I believe it is unfair to apply this only to students, teachers managing many students must make compromises. Amortization occurs over large populations, not the small minority.

Students, somewhat, are responsible for informing the professor or teacher of their own difficulties, but to make it the only means can definitely be discriminatory. In the end, all situations like these are nuanced, and fall somewhere in-between. Students need to advocate, but teachers need to see those who are trying to advocate for themselves.

Where you grew up; how you grew up; your parents expectations; societal expectations.
These are things that students come in with, and it makes a significant impact on their abilities. While it is difficult, it is not their fault, and any reactionary response from them regarding it is typically outside of their control. I know what it is like first-hand, and so I am very familiar with how it feels.

I learned many techniques in PER.

Classrooms are inherently collaborative, and as such students must also be attuned to the needs and requirements of other students. In order to best do so, proactive discussion between students about their needs, as well as teacher guidance, is required so that students can learn their best.

Talk about discipline, student management, and expectations.
Being asked to leave is something that needs normalizing, but only after at minimum a warning, unless it is flagrantly a problem (I.e. using a racial slur).

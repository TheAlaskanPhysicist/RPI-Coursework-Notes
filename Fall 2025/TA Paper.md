Write a reflective paper (3-5 pages) that synthesizes your learning across the seven presentations you attended as part of the TA training. Your submission should include the following components:
1. Key takeways - identify one or two key takeaways from each talk and explain why you felt these were important for you as a TA.
2. For each topic presented describe a specific example (either from past experiences or a hypothetical one) for how you may apply what you learned in your own teaching.
3. Conclude with a one page writeup of your teaching philosophy. A teaching philosophy should include things such as your approach to facilitating students' learning, your goals for yourself and for your students, your intended/preferred teaching practices and how they align with your goals, your strategies for assessing student learning, and any specific interests you have that define who you are as a teacher/TA.
